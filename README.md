### Description

Hi, I found this Coding Standard tutorial somewhere on Net and customized it according our company specifications to refer. Now, This is for you all.

This document is a working document - it is not designed to meet the requirement that we have coding standard but instead is an acknowledgment that we can make our lives much easier in the long term if we all agree to a common set of conventions when writing code.

Inevitably, there are many places in this document where I have simply had to make a choice between two or more equally valid alternatives. I have tried to actually think about the relative merits of each alternative but inevitably some of my personal preferences have come into play. I hope that this has only happened where it was a line-ball anyway.

This document is not fixed in concrete, but it is not a suggestion, either. The only thing worse than no coding standard is multiple coding standards so these coding standards are mandatory where they apply (see the section "WhenDoesThisDocumentApply".

However, if you think that something could be improved, or even if you think that I've made a wrong call somewhere, then e-mail me and let's discuss it.

I hope you find that this document is actually readable. I hate standards documents that are so dry as to be about as interesting as reading the white pages. However, do not assume that this document is any less important or is treated any less lightly by SteelRX management than its drier cousins; believe me, SteelRX takes these standards very seriously.

Hope You will like that... As its not sololy mine... no need to vote... :-)

Sorry Just for the size and html tags constraint i had to post the same in a zip file, may be for your convinience. Enjoy!! Coding....
